1.APPEND_SLASH=True
The APPEND_SLASH setting in Django controls whether URLs that lack a trailing slash 
should be automatically redirected to a URL with a trailing slash. By default, this 
setting is True, meaning that Django will append a slash to the URL if it's not present 
and if the URL without the trailing slash does not match any patterns but the URL with the
 trailing slash does.
 
 
2.PREPEND_WWW = True

When PREPEND_WWW is True, if a user requests a URL that does not start with "www.",
 Django will automatically redirect the user to the equivalent URL with "www." prefixed.
 By default it is false.
 
 
3.ROOT_URLCONF='MYPORJECT.urls'
this setting specifies where your root url configurations are defined..by default it is
<projectname>.urls
