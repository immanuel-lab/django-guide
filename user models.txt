User Models in Django


Django provides several ways to create user models, each with its own characteristics. Here are three types of user models:



1. AbstractBaseUser
AbstractBaseUser is a base class that provides the basic functionality for user models.
It includes fields like password, last_login, and is_active.
You can subclass AbstractBaseUser to create a custom user model with additional fields.
When using AbstractBaseUser, you need to define the USERNAME_FIELD and REQUIRED_FIELDS attributes.
Example:
Python
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractBaseUser, BaseUserManager

class CustomUserManager(BaseUserManager):
    def create_user(self, email, password=None):
        # Create a user instance
        pass

class CustomUser(AbstractBaseUser):
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
    USERNAME_FIELD = 'email'
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = []
    objects = CustomUserManager()
	
	
2. AbstractUser
AbstractUser is a subclass of AbstractBaseUser that includes additional fields like username, first_name, last_name, and email.
It provides a more complete user model that can be subclassed to add custom fields.
When using AbstractUser, you can customize the user model by adding or removing fields.
Example:
Python
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser

class CustomUser(AbstractUser):
    phone_number = models.CharField(max_length=20)
	
	
	
3. BaseUser
There is no BaseUser class in Django's authentication system. The base classes are AbstractBaseUser and AbstractUser.
In summary, AbstractBaseUser provides the basic functionality for user models, while AbstractUser provides a more complete user model that can be customized. When creating a custom user model, you can choose to subclass either AbstractBaseUser or AbstractUser depending on your needs.
