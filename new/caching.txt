
In Django REST Framework (DRF), caching refers to the process of storing HTTP 
responses so that they can be reused later, thereby improving the performance and 
scalability of your API. 
Caching can be particularly useful when dealing with endpoints that return data that 

doesn't change frequently, such as static content or data retrieved from a database that 
is not frequently updated.


DRF provides built-in support for caching through its @cache_page decorator, \
which can be applied to views or viewsets to cache the responses they generate.
 Here's how it works:

Decorator Usage: You can use the @cache_page decorator to cache the output of a
 view for a specified amount of time. For example:
 
 from django.views.decorators.cache import cache_page
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response

class MyAPIView(APIView):
    @cache_page(60 * 15)  # Cache for 15 minutes
    def get(self, request):
        # Your view logic here
        return Response(...)
