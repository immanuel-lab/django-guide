what all classes are available in channels.generic.websocket
Meta AI
The channels.generic.websocket module in Django Channels provides several classes for handling WebSocket connections. Here are some of the main classes available:
1.WebSocketConsumer: This is the base class for all WebSocket consumers. It provides the basic functionality for handling WebSocket connections, including methods for handling incoming messages, sending messages, and closing the connection.
2.AsyncWebSocketConsumer: This class is similar to WebSocketConsumer, but it provides asynchronous support using Python's async/await syntax.
3.JsonWebsocketConsumer: This class is a subclass of WebSocketConsumer that provides additional functionality for handling JSON-encoded messages. It automatically encodes and decodes JSON messages, making it easier to work with JSON data.
4.AsyncJsonWebsocketConsumer: This class is similar to JsonWebsocketConsumer, but it provides asynchronous support using Python's async/await syntax.





These classes provide a range of functionality for handling WebSocket connections, including:
connect: Called when the WebSocket connection is established.
receive: Called when a message is received from the client.
send: Sends a message to the client.
close: Called when the WebSocket connection is closed.
disconnect: Called when the WebSocket connection is disconnected.
By using these classes, you can build robust and scalable WebSocket applications with Django Channels.
