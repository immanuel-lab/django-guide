eval()-. If you want to get input from the user with a specific data type (e.g., integer, float, etc.), you can use the eval() function.
max() and min()-Return the maximum or minimum value in a list or other sequence.


hash()=The hash() function in Python is a built-in function that returns the hash value of an object. 
This hash value is an integer that serves as a unique identifier for the object within a 
specific execution of the Python interpreter. The hash() function only works with hashable objects. Hashable objects are immutable, meaning their value cannot change
 after creation

id()-The primary use of id() is to determine if two variables or expressions refer to the exact
 same object in memory, rather than just having the same value

iter()=The iter() function in Python is a built-in function used to obtain an iterator object from an iterable.

next()=The next() function in Python is a built-in function used to retrieve the next item from an iterator. It is fundamental to how iteration works in Python. 


super()=access properties of parent class

Here are some other built-in Python functions:
print(): Prints output to the screen.
len(): Returns the length of a string, list, tuple, or other sequence.
type(): Returns the data type of a variable or value.
max() and min(): Return the maximum or minimum value in a list or other sequence.
sum(): Returns the sum of all elements in a list or other sequence.
range(): Generates a sequence of numbers for looping.
chr() and ord(): Convert between characters and their ASCII codes.
list(), tuple(), set(), and dict(): Create new instances of these data structures.
zip(): Combines multiple lists into a list of tuples.
enumerate(): Returns a list of tuples containing indices and values from a list.
sorted(): Sorts a list in ascending or descending order.
reversed(): Returns a reversed iterator over a sequence.
all() and any(): Check if all or any elements in a list are true.
filter(): Returns an iterator over elements in a list that meet a condition.
map(): Applies a function to each element in a list.
reduce(): Applies a function to each element in a list, reducing it to a single value.
hex(), oct(), and bin(): Convert integers to hexadecimal, octal, or binary strings.
round(): Rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places.
pow(): Raises a number to a power.
abs(): Returns the absolute value of a number.
These are just a few of the many built-in functions in Python. Let me know if you have any specific questions about any of these!
