In Django, decorators can be used to add functionality to model methods and properties. Beyond @property, there are several other useful decorators and patterns you can apply to Django models to enhance their behavior.

Common Decorators for Django Models
@property:
Converts a method into a read-only attribute.

python
Copy code
class Person(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    date_of_birth = models.DateField()

    @property
    def age(self):
        today = date.today()
        age = today.year - self.date_of_birth.year
        if today.month < self.date_of_birth.month or (today.month == self.date_of_birth.month and today.day < self.date_of_birth.day):
            age -= 1
        return age

		@cached_property:
Caches the result of a method the first time it is accessed, to avoid recalculating it on subsequent accesses. This is useful for expensive calculations.

python
Copy code
from django.utils.functional import cached_property

class Person(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    date_of_birth = models.DateField()

    @cached_property
    def age(self):
        today = date.today()
        age = today.year - self.date_of_birth.year
        if today.month < self.date_of_birth.month or (today.month == self.date_of_birth.month and today.day < self.date_of_birth.day):
            age -= 1
        return age

		@classmethod:
Defines a method that is bound to the class and not the instance of the class. These methods can be called on the class itself, rather than on an instance.

python
Copy code
class Person(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    date_of_birth = models.DateField()

    @classmethod
    def create(cls, name, date_of_birth):
        return cls(name=name, date_of_birth=date_of_birth)
@staticmethod:
Defines a method that does not access or modify the class or instance it is defined in. It behaves like a regular function but belongs to the classâ€™s namespace.

python
Copy code
class Person(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    date_of_birth = models.DateField()

    @staticmethod
    def is_adult(age):
        return age >= 18
Custom Decorators
You can also create custom decorators to encapsulate common functionality or validation logic that you want to apply to your model methods.

Custom Decorator Example:
Suppose you want to log method calls on your model methods. You can create a decorator for this purpose.

python
Copy code
import logging
from functools import wraps

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def log_method_call(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        logger.info(f'Calling method {func.__name__}')
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper
Applying the Custom Decorator:

python
Copy code
class Person(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    date_of_birth = models.DateField()

    @log_method_call
    def get_full_name(self):
        return f'{self.name} (age: {self.age})'
Using Signals as Decorators
Django signals allow you to execute code in response to certain events, such as model saves or deletions. While not exactly a decorator, they provide similar functionality by allowing you to "decorate" actions with additional behavior.

Using Signals:

python
Copy code
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver

@receiver(post_save, sender=Person)
def person_post_save(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    logger.info(f'Person {instance.name} was saved.')
Summary
Using decorators in Django models can enhance the functionality and maintainability of your code. Some common patterns include:

@property: For dynamic, read-only attributes.
@cached_property: For caching the results of expensive computations.
@classmethod: For methods that are bound to the class rather than instances.
@staticmethod: For utility methods that do not require class or instance context.
Custom decorators: For logging, validation, or other cross-cutting concerns.
Signals: For handling events in a decoupled manner.
By leveraging these decorators, you can make your Django models more powerful and easier to work with.
